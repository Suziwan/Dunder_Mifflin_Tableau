## Create a dashboard using Tableau

The following dashboard presents the results of sales and profits for the East region.  
It offers filters option on years (2020 to 2023) and products sub-categories.  
This allows to visualize with more clarity (per year) and see the effect of a product of overall profits.

Conclusion:  
The bashboard can help make decisions for example on which products to eliminate, and which stores are less profitable.  
By joining tables of products returns, another analysis could be made for KPIs related to customers satisfaction.
